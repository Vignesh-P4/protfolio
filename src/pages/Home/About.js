Hello, my name is Vignesh Pobbathi. I'm currently a student passionate about full-stack web development, with a particular focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I enjoy building dynamic, user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow my skills and tackle new challenges through hands-on projects. Aside from coding, I love exploring emerging technologies and collaborating with like-minded people to create innovative solutions.
